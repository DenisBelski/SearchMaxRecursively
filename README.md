# Finding the maximum value in an array using recursion
This project implemented a solution to display the maximum value in an array using recursion.
The user himself enters the size of the array. The program displays an array of randomly generated values from 0 to 1000.
Also, for display convenience, the size of the array is limited (max 1000 elements).
